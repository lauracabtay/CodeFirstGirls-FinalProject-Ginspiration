# Code First Girls Final Project

## Lessons Learned

This project has helped me improve on the use of flexbox, allowing for a better / more responsive experience.

The modal boxes helped me get a better understanding of how JS works.

Working on this project in a group setting was a very interesting experience, especially as it did come with some challenges around version control / collaborating on the same document. This gave us a hint of what real-life web development in a team looks like.
